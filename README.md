if you have bower installed on your machine, then run <code>bower install</code> to install all the required dependencies.
if you don't have bower then please refer to https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/README.md

in case you don't wanna use bower, then just download <code>jquery, font-awesome</code> and link them to your project and you will be fine to go.
